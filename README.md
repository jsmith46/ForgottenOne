# ForgottenOne

Long ago, there was a Gate that joined two realms. <br /> 
<br />
One was the Mortal Realm, flourishing grounds for humans and animals to live and prosper. <br /> 
Crystal clear rivers slashed the green land, domed by a blue sky. <br /> 
The other was the Greater Realm, home to the Iruls- mighty guardians of the Mortal Realm. <br /> 
Unlike mortals, the Iruls were born of magic. <br /> 
There was the Irul of Joy, who brought merriment into the lives of mortals; <br /> 
Irul of wisdom, who guided the mortals to achieve great heights; <br /> 
Irul of animals, who ensured the critters had a voice; <br /> 
and many more. <br /> 
The Greater Realm was ruled by the Irul of Darkness, Queen Kehira. <br /> 
The Iruls would descend upon the Mortal Realm to ensure peace and harmony, <br /> 
and in return, the mortals would offer them gifts and sacrifices. <br /> 
The more followers an Irul had, the stronger their powers would grow.<br /> 
The Iruls and mortals benefited from each other, and both realms lived in harmony<br /> 
<br /> 
Yet, a time came when the mortals became ungrateful.<br /> 
They wanted more. <br /> 
Peace did not satisfy their desires as they wished to acquire greater material wealth. <br /> 
They began to cheat and kill, taking advantage of the weaker amongst their own kind. <br /> 
War replaced harmony. <br /> 
A new chaos began to brew, and with it, a new Irul was born- *Ezbril*, the Irul of Destruction and Chaos. <br /> 
<br /> 
Ezbril took upon himself the mission to rein in the disorder of the Mortal Realm- <br /> 
task only the Irul of Destruction and Chaos could accomplish.<br /> 
He succeeded, but he took drastic measures to accomplish his goal,<br /> 
and committed a sin.<br /> 
A sin so terrible, it was deemed unspeakable.<br /> 
Regretful of his own crimes, Ezbril vowed to never set foot into the Mortal Realm again. <br /> 
<br /> 
Life for mortals returned to normal, but they now deemed themselves independent. <br /> 
They were clever with their inventions, and saw no value in the blessings of the Irul. <br /> 
Where once prayers and songs of praise rose to a crescendo, smoke and iron polluted the newly cobbled streets.<br /> 
Rows of market vendors replaced the once sacred shrines.<br /> 
<br /> 
Soon, <br /> 
<br /> 
 &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   the Irul <br /> <br /> 
 &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  were forgotten.
